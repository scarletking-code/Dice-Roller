# Dice-Roller
Implement a function which will generate random numbers (use the random package) to 
simulate the rolling of many-sided dice. It will be called with two parameters: how many dice, and 
how many sides. It will print to standard output the number of dice, number of sides, all the numbers 
generated, the total, and the highest number rolled.


In another cell, write code which will prompt the user (using the input function) to type in 
a number of dice to roll, then prompt the user for how many sides. If either input is not a 
positive integer, a message will be displayed warning the user of the invalid input explaining 
why it was invalid, and the user will continue to be prompted again until their input is valid.
Once the user has inputted a valid number of dice and a valid number of sides, the dice will 
be rolled using the function you defined.
